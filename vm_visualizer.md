# VM Visualizer

## Purpose
Nostalgia

## Goal
Take a virtual box configuration file and render as a desktop.

For examples:

If I want to see:
* 1 hard drive with its "physical size" for each storage controller
* CD rom drive if present.
* 2 Ethernet cards (1 bridge, 1 NAT)
  + A wire connected from each to a router looking thing (with the network name)
* Sticks of ram divided into 512 pieces or if > 2G: 1G bigger pieces.
* Number of processors (little squares)
* Video Card With little squares for each MB of vram.
* Audio jack if enabled.


Common data format for piping into different renderers.

Different renderers could be ATX vs mini-AT visualizations.
R2D2 for fun?
